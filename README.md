# Team Builder (ONGOING PROJECT)

This React / Next.js / Node project uses TypeScript and JavaScript.

Use the tools on this web app to algorithmically generate and build your own competitively viable team in Pokemon, taking into account type coverage, stats, and theme.
There are tools for learning to build teams yourself instead of generating, for example a Type Memoriser component that assists with remembering which types are effective against eachother.

These teams can also be shared for others to see, so you can see what is popular in the moment or highly rated by others.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
